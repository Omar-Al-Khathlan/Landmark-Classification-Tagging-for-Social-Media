## Project: Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media

Project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed a deep learning model using Pytorch to detect and classify landmarks.

In order to complete this project, I used the GPU enabled workspaces within the Udacity classroom.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)
- [cv2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [matplotlib (2.0.2)](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/)
- [torch (1.9.0)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
- [torchvision (0.10.0)](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html)
- [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installion [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `landmark.ipynb` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook landmark.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook landmark.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software in your browser.

### Data
The landmark images used for this project are a subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2. The dataset used for this project is quite large and can be downloaded by following this [link](https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip).

You can find license information for the full dataset [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset).
